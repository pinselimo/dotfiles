# Layout stuff:
#
    # You can "split" the current object of your focus with
    # $mod+b or $mod+v, for horizontal and vertical splits
    # respectively.
    #bindsym $mod+b splith
    bindsym --to-code $mod+v splitt

    # Switch the current container between different layout styles
    bindsym --to-code $mod+s layout stacking
    bindsym --to-code $mod+w layout tabbed
    bindsym --to-code $mod+e layout toggle split

    # Make the current focus fullscreen
    bindsym --to-code $mod+f fullscreen

    # Toggle the current focus between tiling and floating mode
    bindsym $mod+Shift+space floating toggle

    # Make a floating window sticky
    bindsym $mod+Shift+b sticky toggle

    # Swap focus between the tiling area and the floating area
    bindsym $mod+space focus mode_toggle

    # Move focus to the parent container
    bindsym --to-code $mod+a focus parent

# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
    bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
    bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
